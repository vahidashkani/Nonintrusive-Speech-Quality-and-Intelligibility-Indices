# Nonintrusive-Speech-Quality-and-Intelligibility-Indices
This work aims to develop non-intrusive quality and intelligibility indices using a custom database of noisy speech recorded in a HA test box. In this paper, we introduced a novel non-intrusive model designed to assess speech quality and intelligibility leveraging automatic speech recognition and self-supervised learning techniques.
